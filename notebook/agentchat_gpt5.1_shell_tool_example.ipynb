    "# Shell Tool with OpenAI Responses API\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: [Priyanshu Deshmukh](https://github.com/priyansh4320)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the shell tool with OpenAI's Responses API. The shell tool allows models to execute shell commands through your integration, enabling them to interact with your local computer through a controlled command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning: Running arbitrary shell commands can be dangerous. Always sandbox execution or add strict allow-/deny-lists before forwarding commands to the system shell in production.**"
