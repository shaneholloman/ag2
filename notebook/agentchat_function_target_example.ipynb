    "# Validating Agent Output With FunctionTarget: A Comprehensive Guide to Custom Validation in Multi-Agent Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use `FunctionTarget` to implement custom validation logic that intercepts and validates agent outputs before they proceed to the next stage in a multi-agent conversation. You'll learn how to create validation functions that can accept or reject agent responses, route messages to different agents based on validation results, and maintain context throughout the conversation flow."
