"""Hub-backed :class:`CheckpointStore` impl.

``HubBackedCheckpointStore`` is the canonical default for networked
agents: it delegates :meth:`write` / :meth:`read` to
``checkpoint_task`` / ``read_task_checkpoint``, which persist a single
JSON blob per ``task_id`` under the hub's ``KnowledgeStore``. It
accepts either an in-process :class:`Hub` or a :class:`HubClient` —
both expose those two methods, so the checkpoint path is direct
in-process and an RPC round-trip cross-process without the owner code
changing. Standalone agents that don't need cross-process durability
can use any other :class:`CheckpointStore` impl — or omit
checkpointing entirely.
