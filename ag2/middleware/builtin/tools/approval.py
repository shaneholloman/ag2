        timeout: Seconds to wait for the human's answer before giving up, or
            ``None`` (the default) to wait as long as it takes. An approval is a
            question for a person, so a deadline is the caller's decision to

            :class:`~ag2.exceptions.HumanInputTimeoutError` and the gated tool
            does not run.
        allow_always: When ``True``, the user can respond with ``always`` to
            approve the current and all subsequent calls of the same tool in the
            same context. The answer covers only the tool implementation that was
            asked about: a different tool with the same name is still asked.
