    are resolved member by member, after they discover their tools.

    Precedence, when two tools share a name:

    * Tools declared in code override each other in order: the later one wins,
      like a dict update. Built-in tools count as declared in code.
    * A tool an MCP server reports at runtime never overrides one declared in
      code, wherever its toolkit sits; it is dropped with a warning.
    * Between two MCP servers, the first server's tool wins; the other is
      dropped with a warning.

    Built-in schemas of one type may repeat (e.g. several ``MCPServerTool``
    servers); only a function name clashes with them. A dropped tool is not
    registered, so it never receives a call.
