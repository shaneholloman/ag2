"""Command-level filters used by :class:`ShellAdapter`.

The adapter implements the ``allowed`` / ``blocked`` / ``ignore`` / ``readonly``
shell surface on top of any :class:`~ag2.tools.sandbox.base.Sandbox`.
These helpers live in the sandbox package so the adapter can import them without
triggering ``shell`` package initialisation (which would re-enter sandbox and
deadlock).
