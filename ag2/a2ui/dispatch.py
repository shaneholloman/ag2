    """Execute one turn and yield its prose then A2UI message frames.

    Server-side actions are handled first and never invoke the agent: each
    incoming click whose name maps to a ``server_actions`` entry runs that
    action and its result is yielded as A2UI message frames. The agent then
    runs only if the turn still has input for it (a user message, or a click on
    a button with no registered action) — a turn carrying *only* server-side
    clicks skips the agent entirely.

    Args:
        agent: The plain ``Agent`` to run. Must have ``config`` set (unless the
            turn carries only server-side clicks, in which case it is not run).
        runtime: The A2UI runtime supplying the prompt section, validation
            middleware, and catalog/capabilities helpers.
        request: The parsed turn (history, current inputs, prompt, variables).
        server_actions: Action name → :class:`A2UIAction` for ``@a2ui_action``
            buttons, executed on click without invoking the agent.
        usage_records: Filled with this turn's :class:`~ag2.events.UsageEvent`
            events as they are sent, for a transport that reports what the turn
            cost. The list is the caller's because the turn's stream is not: it
            is created here and never leaves, and a caller handed the records
            only on a clean return would have none for a turn that raised —
            which is the turn whose cost most wants reporting.
        interrupter: Where a question the agent asks goes. Supplied only by a
            transport that can put it to whoever is connected, and only when the
            agent has no hook of its own.
        on_task: Called with each ``TaskStarted`` / ``TaskCompleted`` /
            ``TaskFailed`` / ``TaskCancelled`` / ``TaskExpired`` on the turn's
            stream, for a transport that reports delegations.
        on_tool_call: Called with each tool call on the turn's stream.
        on_tool_result: Called with each tool result on the turn's stream.

    Yields:
        Any server-action :class:`A2UIMessageFrame`s first, then (when the agent
        runs) an :class:`A2UIProseFrame` for its prose followed by an
        :class:`A2UIMessageFrame` per A2UI message it produced.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the agent must run but has no ``config`` to create an
            LLM client.
