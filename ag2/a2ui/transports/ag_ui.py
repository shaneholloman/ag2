"""AG-UI transport: serve a turn over AG-UI so CopilotKit's
``@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer`` renders the agent's A2UI output.

Reuses the A2UI turn core (``_A2UITurnCore.run_turn``) and the AG-UI history
mapping from ``ag2.ag_ui`` **without modifying** either. The agent's
validated A2UI messages are collected per turn and emitted as a single AG-UI
``ActivitySnapshotEvent`` whose ``content`` carries them under the
``a2ui_operations`` key — the exact wire contract the renderer consumes
(verified against CopilotKit
``packages/react-core/src/v2/a2ui/A2UIMessageRenderer.tsx``).

Because the prose comes from the turn core's final, A2UI-stripped message (not
live model chunks), the raw ``<a2ui-json>`` block never leaks into the streamed
text. Importing this module requires Starlette and ``ag2[ag-ui]``.
