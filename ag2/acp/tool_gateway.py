"""Expose an AG2 agent's locally-executable tools to an ACP CLI agent over MCP.

``partition_tools`` splits the turn's tool schemas into (a) function tools the
:class:`ToolGateway` serves itself over an in-process streamable-HTTP MCP
server, and (b) external ``MCPServerTool`` servers translated directly into ACP
``mcp_servers`` entries. Provider server-side builtin tools (``web_search`` and
friends) are flags inside a provider API request — there is nothing local to
execute — so they are rejected with :class:`~ag2.exceptions.UnsupportedToolError`;
CLI agents ship their own native equivalents.

The ``mcp`` SDK — together with the ``uvicorn``/``starlette`` server stack it
depends on — ships with the ``acp`` extra. A broken install surfaces on
``import ag2.acp`` with the ``ag2[acp]`` install hint (see the package
``__init__``).
