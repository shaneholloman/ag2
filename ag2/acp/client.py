"""``ACPClient`` — the :class:`LLMClient` that drives a CLI agent over ACP.

One AG2 model turn maps to one ACP ``session/prompt``. The agent's own tool loop
runs inside that single call; ``session/update`` notifications stream onto the
AG2 event stream via the bridge, and the accumulated text becomes a
``ModelResponse``.

Lifecycle: the framework calls ``config.create()`` once per ``AgentRun``, so the
live ACP session is keyed by ``context.stream.id`` in a per-config registry and
reused across the run's internal model-turns. A ``weakref.finalize`` on the
stream terminates the subprocess if the run is dropped without an explicit
``config.aclose()``. When the run's tools include function tools, a per-session
:class:`~.tool_gateway.ToolGateway` serves them to the agent over HTTP MCP; it
lives and dies with the session.
