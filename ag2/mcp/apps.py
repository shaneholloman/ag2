"""Serve an interactive document — an MCP App — alongside an AG2 agent.

An **app** is a document plus the tools that render it::

    shop = MCPApp("ui://shop/card", CARD_HTML)

    @shop.tool
    async def show_item(item_id: str) -> Item:
        \"\"\"Show a product card.\"\"\"
        return await catalog.get(item_id)

    server = MCPServer(agent, apps=[shop])

The constraint that shapes this whole API: a host reads the document **in
parallel with** the call that references it, so the document cannot be built
from the call's arguments. It is a static body registered as a resource; the
per-call data reaches it as ``structuredContent`` on the result, which the host
redelivers into the frame as a ``ui/notifications/tool-result`` notification.
That is the opposite of :mod:`ag2.mcp_ui`, which builds HTML inside the handler
from the arguments it was given. The two are alternatives; this module does not
replace that one.

Nothing here is a dead end. :attr:`MCPApp.tools` are ordinary
:class:`~ag2.mcp.MCPFunctionTool`\\ s, :attr:`MCPApp.resource` is an ordinary
:class:`~ag2.mcp.Resource`, and ``apps=[app]`` is defined as shorthand for
passing those two to ``tools=`` and ``resources=`` by hand.

    """A document and the tools that render it.

    ``uri`` must use the ``ui://`` scheme — a host discards anything else — and
    is validated here rather than on the wire.

    ``content`` is the document body, in one of four forms, told apart by type
    alone rather than by inspecting the filesystem:

    * a ``str`` — always literal HTML, never a filename;
    * an ``os.PathLike[str]`` — always a file, read on **every** resource read,
      so a rebuilt bundle is picked up without restarting the server;
    * a ``Variable`` — resolved per request from the ``AskContext`` the server's
      ``context_provider`` returned;
    * a sync or async callable invoked per read, matching
      :class:`~ag2.mcp.Resource`'s reader contract. It may declare ``Variable``,
      ``Depends``/``Inject`` and :data:`~ag2.mcp.MCPRequestContext` parameters,
      which resolve like a tool's.

    An overload per form makes each one visible in an IDE.

    ``name`` identifies the resource and defaults to the URI; ``title`` and
    ``description`` are what a client shows for it in ``resources/list``, so they
    are worth setting only alongside ``listed=True``.

    ``listed`` defaults to false, keeping the document out of ``resources/list``
    — the specification permits omitting UI-only resources, and a person browsing
    a server's resources should not meet a file that is not one. Set it true for
    a document meant to be discoverable.

    ``csp``, ``permissions``, ``domain`` and ``prefers_border`` are the document's
    sandbox policy, written into the resource's ``_meta.ui``; they are the SDK's
    own models, so the wire spelling is never guessed at. ``meta`` is a raw
    passthrough merged alongside, for whatever the specification adds next — and
    here a ``ui`` key in it *merges over* the typed parameters rather than being
    refused, because on a document that slot is shared. On a tool it is not:
    ``@app.tool``'s ``meta`` rejects a ``ui`` key outright, since there the only
    thing in that slot is the binding the decorator itself writes.

    ``inject_runtime`` controls injection of the document runtime (see
    :meth:`runtime_script`). Turn it off for a document that brings its own
    bundle: the body is then served byte-for-byte as given.
