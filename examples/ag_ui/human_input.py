"""An agent served over AG-UI stops to ask a human, and a client answers it.

Two exchanges, one turn. The first ends with ``RUN_FINISHED`` carrying an
*interrupt* while the agent's own function is still suspended inside
``context.input``; the second — a new run id on the **same thread** — delivers
the answer into that suspended call and carries the rest of the turn.

Both halves run here: the server is the ASGI app, and the client posts at it
over in-process HTTP, so there is no port to pick and nothing to start first.
