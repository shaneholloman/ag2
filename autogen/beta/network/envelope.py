"""Envelope — the wire shape for every message between agents.

Every Agent-to-Agent exchange happens inside a session and the carrier
is an ``Envelope``. Envelopes are JSON-serialisable, hub-stamped at
``post_envelope``, and persisted to the per-session WAL. ``audience``
is the addressing primitive: ``None`` broadcasts within the session,
a list targets a subset.

    * ``audience`` — ``None`` broadcasts within the session; a list
      targets a subset. Hub WAL stores the full envelope regardless of
      addressing (audit + debug); ``notify`` lands only on listed peers.
    * ``causation_id`` — envelope this is responding to. Used by view
      policies to thread replies to their prompts.
    * ``depth`` — delegation hop count. Hub auto-increments on the
      reply path; ``Rule.limits.delegation_depth`` caps it.
    * ``ttl_seconds`` — per-envelope TTL. ``None`` defers to the
      session's ``expires_at``.
    * ``idempotency_key`` — dedup key reserved for cross-process
      transports; the in-process hub serialises under a per-session lock
      and ignores it.
