"""``MCPToolkit`` against a live HTTP MCP server, through its real session construction.

The rest of ``test/tools/test_mcp.py`` substitutes ``_mcp_session`` for a fake,
which is right for tool proxying and content mapping but leaves the transport
itself — the client, the handshake, the wire — untouched. This module is the one
place that exercises it, so a change to how the streamable-HTTP session is built
cannot ship unexercised.

Lives apart from ``test_mcp.py`` because serving on a real socket needs
``uvicorn``, which ships with ``ag2[acp]`` and not ``ag2[mcp]``; the skip guard
carried by :mod:`test._serving` would otherwise take the fake-session tests
down with it.

It is also the only place an AG2 agent asks and another AG2 agent answers.
Everything else tests one side against a double, so a wire-level disagreement
between the two halves — a state token round-tripped wrongly, an answer keyed to
the wrong question, a capability advertised in one shape and read in another —
survives both suites and fails only here.
