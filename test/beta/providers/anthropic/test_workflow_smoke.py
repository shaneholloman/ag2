"""Workflow smoke test against a real LLM.

A 3-agent swarm runs end-to-end via tool-driven handoffs. Triage
agent calls ``transfer_to_eng(reason)`` → eng agent replies →
``RevertToInitiatorTarget`` brings control back to triage → triage
closes via ``TerminateTarget``. Workflow state survives
``Hub.hydrate()`` mid-flow.

Uses ``claude-haiku-4-5`` for cost; loads ``.env`` from the repo
root; skips if ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` is unset; marked
``@pytest.mark.anthropic`` so the default unit run skips it.
