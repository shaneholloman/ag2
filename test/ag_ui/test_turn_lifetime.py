"""A served turn's lifetime belongs to the server, not to the HTTP exchange.

Nothing here is user-visible: it is the prefactor the interrupt work stands on.
An interrupt is delivered as the *terminating* event of its exchange, so the
response closes by design while the agent is still suspended mid-function — and
under the old shape, where the agent ran inside the exchange's task group, that
is exactly when it was cancelled.

This is the one place in that work driven through the single-exchange seam
rather than in-process HTTP: it ships before any interrupt exists, so at the HTTP
seam there is nothing yet that can end an exchange early. The response is closed
by hand instead, and what is asserted is that the agent reaches code past it.
