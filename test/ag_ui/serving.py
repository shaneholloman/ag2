"""Driving a served agent the way a client drives it: real POSTs over in-process HTTP.

A paused turn is two exchanges sharing state, which the single-exchange
generator seam cannot express — so these helpers post real requests at the
built ASGI application instead, and read only what a client can see on the wire.
Frames come back in the same shape `harness` decodes, so `types_of`, `only`
and `every` read a run driven either way.

Importing this module needs `starlette` and `httpx`; it is meant to be reached
from inside `test/ag_ui/served/`, whose package guard skips those tests when
starlette is absent.
