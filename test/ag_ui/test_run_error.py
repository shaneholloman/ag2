"""The AG-UI failure path: what a client sees when a run dies partway through.

``dispatch`` re-raises after emitting ``RUN_ERROR``, and anyio surfaces that out of
its task group wrapped in an exception group — so a test must expect the group and
unwrap it. The event still arrives first: the memory object stream carrying events to
the encoder is unbuffered, so the send blocks until the consumer takes it and only
then does the re-raise run.
