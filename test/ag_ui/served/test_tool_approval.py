"""A tool call puts itself to the client before it runs, and the client decides.

The second reason a run pauses, on the mechanism the question path already
built: no new lifecycle, one new occasion for it, and a refusal that stops the
tool without failing the turn — the wording being the in-process approval
middleware's own, not a second vocabulary for the same idea.
