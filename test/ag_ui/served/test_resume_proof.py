"""Whoever answers an interrupt has to be whoever the interrupt was put to.

An answer attributed to a human is the input an agent trusts most, and without
this the interrupt id is a bare string in a request body. The protocol reserves
an envelope beside the answer for exactly this — signatures and routing keys,
never the answer itself — and requires clients to carry it back.
