[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s API and models are fully supported in AG2. You will need an OpenAI account and to create an API key. [See their website for further details](https://openai.com/).

## Installation

<Warning>
**From version 0.8**: The OpenAI package, `openai`, is not installed by default, install it with the `openai` extra as shown below.
</Warning>

``` bash
pip install ag2[openai]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `ag2`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[openai]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U ag2[openai]
```
as `autogen` and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

## LLM Configurations

See the [LLM Configuration](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/llm-configuration) for further details on setting an creating an LLM configuration.

The below example of an `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` shows how the OpenAI client class is used.
By specifying the `api_type` as `openai`, the client will use the OpenAI ChatCompletion API.

```python
[
    {
        "api_type": "openai",
        "model": "o1",
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",
    },
    {
        "api_type": "openai", # use OpenAI ChatCompletion API
        "model": "gpt-5-nano",
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",
    }
]
```

As an alternative to the `api_key` key and value in the config, you can set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI key.

Linux/Mac:
``` bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Windows:
``` bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Extra Headers

You can pass custom HTTP headers on each API request using the `extra_headers` parameter. This is useful when working through API gateways, proxies, or OpenAI-compatible servers that require additional headers for authentication, routing, or observability.

```python
from autogen import LLMConfig

llm_config = LLMConfig(
    api_type="openai",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key="your OpenAI Key goes here",
    extra_headers={
        "X-Custom-Header": "my-value",
    },
)
```

<Note>
`extra_headers` is a per-request parameter passed on each call. This is different from `default_headers`, which is set once on the client constructor and applies to all requests made by that client.
</Note>

## Examples
