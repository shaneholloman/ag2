[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s Responses API is a significant evolution from the Chat Completions and Assistants APIs, offering support for both stateless interactions and structured, stateful conversations.

Additionally, it includes built-in tools for web search, file search, apply_patch ,shell command execution, and computer use. The robust multimodal capabilities of the API also set it apart and will be utilized in our initial support for this API. [See their website for further details](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses).

<Warning>
This OpenAI Responses model provider is currently only supported in a two-agent chat using the agent's `initiate_chat`.

Support for group chat and the `run` methods is planned for a future release.

See the examples in the [Notebook section](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/Notebooks/?tags=responses) of the documentation for examples of using this model provider.
</Warning>

## Installation

``` bash
pip install ag2[openai]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `ag2`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[openai]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U ag2[openai]
```
as `autogen` and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

## LLM Configurations

See the [LLM Configuration](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/llm-configuration) for further details on setting an creating an LLM configuration.

The below example of an `OAI_CONFIG_LIST` shows how the OpenAI client class is used.
By specifying the `api_type` as `responses`, the client will use the OpenAI Responses API.

```python
[
    {
        "api_type": "responses", # use OpenAI Responses API
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "api_key": "your OpenAI Key goes here",

        # Optional: use shell, image_generation, and web_search built-in tools
        # See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=responses
        # and https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses for more tool docs
        "built_in_tools": ["shell", "image_generation", "web_search", "apply_patch", "apply_patch_async"],
    }
]
```

As an alternative to the `api_key` key and value in the config, you can set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI key.

Linux/Mac:
``` bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Windows:
``` bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

<Note>
The `apply_patch` tool enables agents to create, update, and delete files using structured diffs, making it ideal for code editing tasks.
The `shell` tool allows secure, filtered command-line execution. When enabling it, consult the [Shell Tool documentation](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/tools/shell) for configuration options and security guidelines to avoid unsafe shell access.
